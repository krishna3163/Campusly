# IIT Launch Strategy: The "Campus Pioneer" Blueprint

Target Campus: **IIT Bombay / IIT Delhi** (High density, tech-early adopters).

---

## Phase 1: Underground Seed (Weeks 1-4)
*   **Recruitment**: Hire 10 "Campus Pioneers" (Ambassadors). 
    *   2 from Cultural Committee (Visibility).
    *   2 Placement Coordinators (Utility).
    *   4 Hostel General Secretaries (Hubs).
*   **Beta Access**: Exclusive "Founders' Club" badge for first 200 users.
*   **Seeding**: Ambassadors upload 50 sets of high-quality PYQs (Previous Year Questions) and interview logs for top companies (Google, Microsoft, Tower Research).

## Phase 2: Orientation Blitz (Weeks 5-8)
*   **Freshers' Onboarding**: Target the first-year Orientation week.
*   **QR Blitz**: Physical QR stickers on Mess tables, Hostel entries, and Library desks. 
    *   *Caption: "Your senior's secret notes are here."*
*   **WhatsApp Migration**: Release a "WhatsApp Chat Export" tool (simplistic help) or focus on "The Anonymity Benefit" (Confession/Hostel Feed) where WhatsApp fails.

## Phase 3: Utility Locking (Weeks 9-12)
*   **Exam Mode Activation**: 2 weeks before Mid-sems, push the **Study Dashboard**. 
*   **Placement Hub Push**: 4th years get notified of new interview logs from the previous day's company visits. 
*   **Leaderboard**: Weekly rewards (swag, Zomato credits) for top contributors of notes.

## Viral Loops & Incentives
1.  **Referral Loop**: Inviting a hostel-mate unlocks 1GB extra "Cloud Cache" or a "Pioneer" avatar border.
2.  **Interaction Loop**: Gamified reputation — "Upvoting a note helps a peer, gives you Karma."
3.  **Utility Loop**: "You need the exam schedule? It's on Campusly." (Creating dependency).

## Community & Crisis Management
*   **Moderation**: Pioneer-only admin privileges for the Feed. 
*   **Crisis Plan (Anonymous Misuse)**: 
    *   *Mechanism*: Automatic word-filtering for harassment.
    *   *Social*: Community report system (3 reports = shadowban).
    *   *Legal*: Clear "Terms of Service" regarding cyber-bullying.

## Metrics Dashboard Design (Draft)
*   **Coverage**: % of branch/hostel on app.
*   **Content Density**: Number of notes uploaded per subject.
*   **Activity Hotspots**: Which hostel is most active? (Mess-time spikes).
*   **P2P Success**: % of data transferred via local LAN vs. Internet.
